This is a NBA betting website built for the first capstone project in the springboard bootcamp. The backend was built using flask(python) as the framework, and the frontend was build using html/css and javascript. The website calls several apis to get data on nba games and betting odds. A user can log in and filter games based on date, and view the box score for each game. A user can also view all teams roster and schedule. Odds are listed for each game and users can place bets on each game; the payments are processed using stripe (testing key). 

To be deployed on heroku.
